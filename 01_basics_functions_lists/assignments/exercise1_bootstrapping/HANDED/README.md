# Exercise 1 - bootstrapping

Write a program that asks the user for a string (using raw_input()) and a number and prints on the screen that string as many times as the user requested.

Requirements: your program should implement a function called "repeatString(myString, noOfTimes)" which is called from the main body of the program.

Note: We haven't learned about for/while loops yet. If you convert the noOfTimes to an integer by using the:
noOfTimes = int(noOfTimes)
function you can than simply run:
print noOfTimes * myString
