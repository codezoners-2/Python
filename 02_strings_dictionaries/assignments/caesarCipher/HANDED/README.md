# Ceasar cipher

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. More details on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).

Open up the caesarCipher.py file and you'll see the steps you'll have to complete in order to write your first encryption/decryption algorithm.
